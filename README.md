In the center of every galaxy, there may exist a supermassive black hole (SMBH) emitting strong radiation or streams of high-velocity plasma in the form of a wind or a jet. A galaxy, and in particular its nuclear region, with such an “active” central SMBH is termed an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The bolometric luminosity of an AGN, which includes the total radiative luminosity and the kinetic luminosity of the wind or jet, is often comparable or greater than the stellar luminosity of the galaxy.

The energy released by the AGN comes from the gravitational energy of matter accreting
through the galaxy toward the central black hole. Sometimes, a powerful jet is launched from
the environs of the black hole that can propagate at nearly the speed of light through the galaxy
and into the halo of the galaxy, interacting with the interstellar and intergalactic medium.
Other times, the accretion flow forms a highly magnetized accretion disc around the SMBH.
The strong radiation and magnetic fields in the accretion disc can launch powerful winds that
expand into and interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy. The effect of such winds is the focus of my next study.

An AGN wind carrying energy and momentum strongly affects the host galaxy by transferring
some of this energy and momentum to the ISM. In particular, the dense, cold phase of the ISM
consisting of atomic and molecular clouds are strongly affected. The wind can shock, compress,
and disperse clouds, leading to a change in cloud properties and star forming across the entire
galaxy. These effects are collectively called active galactic nucleus feedback.

AGN feedback plays a very important role in galaxy formation (Naab & Ostriker, 2017), in particular at high redshifts, the peak of galaxy formation and black hole growth (Harrison
et al., 2018). It is believed that AGN feedback is the principal mechanism for creating a causal
link between the evolution of the central SMBH and the evolution of the galaxy as a whole on
kpc scales (King, 2003). Observationally, SMBH and galaxies appear to be locked in co-evolution (Rodighiero et al., 2015; Schindler et al., 2016). One of the most important manifestations of SMBH galaxy co-evolution is the M-σ relation, the tight correlation between SMBH mass and velocity dispersion of the bulge in a galaxy (Ferrarese & Merritt, 2000; McConnell & Ma, 2013). 
In my next study, we want to use software PLUTO to examine the dependence of the AGN feedback efficiency as determined by differing measures on 3 dimensions (if computer resources available) or 2 dimensions.

PLUTO is a freely-distributed software for the numerical solution of mixed systems targeting
high Mach number flows in astrophysical fluid dynamics. PLUTO solves the fundamental hydrodynamical equations for our problem
